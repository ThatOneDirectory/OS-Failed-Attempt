You're probably here from Stack Overflow to take a look at the code.
If not, please help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78500501/the-emulator-cannot-access-sector-1-of-my-operating-system-can-anyone-help-trou

PLEASE NOTE: 

0) I added boot_sect.asm and kernel.c for analytical purposes, in the actual code the files were replaced bt their .bin counterparts
1) Forgot to add this at Stack Overflow, the issue also may be the way the files boot_sect.asm and kernel.c were converted into .bin, which is why the conversion commands were added.
2) I DID NOT WRITE THE FILES WITHIN. ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE AUTHOR OF THE PDF ATTACHED. (in fact most of the comments he wrote are still in there.) I just learned the stuff and wanted to try it out, and wrote the code as accurately as i could.

In here is the code, (It doesnt work) along with:
1- the errors I received

2- the code i used to convert the files, (manually, NOT a Makefile) and 

3- the PDF that taught me all this. (Writing a simple operating system from scratch)

Again: All credit goes to the author of the PDF, I edited a few things and probably messed up a little in copying it accurately.
