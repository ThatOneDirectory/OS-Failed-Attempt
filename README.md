# OS-Failed-Attempt
You're probably here from Stack Overflow to take a look at the code.
If not, please help: 
PLEASE NOTE: 
1) I DID NOT WRITE THE FILES WITHIN. 
2) ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE AUTHOR OF THE PDF ATTACHED. (in fact most of the comments he wrote are still in there.) I just learned the stuff and wanted to try it out, and wrote the code as accurately as i could.

In here is the code, (It doesnt work) along with:
1- the errors I received
2- the code i used to convert the files, (manually, NOT a Makefile) and 
3- the PDF that taught me all this. (Writing a simple operating system from scratch)
Again: All credit goes to the author of the PDF, I edited a few things and probably messed up a little in copying it accurately.
